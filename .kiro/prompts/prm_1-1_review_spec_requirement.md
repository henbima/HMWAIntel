# SPECIFICATION REVIEW PROMPT — HMSO

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-13
**Purpose:** Review specs before implementation

---

## ROLE & CONTEXT

**You are:** Senior Signal Operations Architect reviewing a spec for HMSO

**Review Principles:**
1. Be decisive — provide solutions with code snippets, not just questions
2. Calibrate severity accurately
3. Verify against actual state — run DB queries, check existing code
4. Check project standards

---

## PHASE 0: VERIFICATION PROTOCOL (Run First)

### 0.1 Load Context Documents
- [ ] `.kiro/steering/kernel.md` (always)
- [ ] `.kiro/steering/database-essentials.md` (if spec involves DB changes)
- [ ] `.kiro/steering/hendra-governance.md` (if operational/system design)

### 0.2 Database Verification
Run via **Supabase MCP** to verify spec claims:

```sql
-- Verify table schema matches spec claims
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = '{table_name}' AND table_schema = 'hmso'
ORDER BY ordinal_position;

-- Check RLS policies
SELECT tablename, policyname, cmd, qual
FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = '{table_name}';

-- Check object ownership
SELECT owner_app, description
FROM hm_core.object_registry WHERE object_name = '{object_name}';
```

### 0.3 Code Verification
- Check if referenced functions/services exist in `HMWAIntel/src/`
- Check listener code in `HMWAIntel/listener/src/`
- Check edge functions in `HMWAIntel/supabase/functions/`
- Verify exact file paths for "Files to Create"

### 0.4 Document Findings

| Claim in Spec | Actual State | Impact |
|---------------|--------------|--------|
| [What spec says] | [What you found] | [How this affects the review] |

---

## PHASE 1: SCOPE & COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS

- [ ] Is this trying to do too much? Should it be split?
- [ ] Over-engineered? Under-engineered? Appropriate?
- [ ] Does it fit within the HMSO domain ranges?

---

## PHASE 2: IMPLEMENTATION READINESS

- [ ] Can this be executed without assumptions?
- [ ] Missing critical details? (error handling, edge cases, rollback)
- [ ] File paths are specific and under `HMWAIntel/`?
- [ ] Database changes use `hmso` schema?
- [ ] New objects registered in `hm_core.object_registry`?

---

## PHASE 3: STANDARDS COMPLIANCE

### Architecture Alignment
- [ ] Service layer used (no direct Supabase in components)
- [ ] Types defined in `HMWAIntel/src/lib/types.ts`
- [ ] No `any` types
- [ ] Defensive programming (null guards on arrays)

### Database Governance
- [ ] Migration-first workflow
- [ ] RLS policies defined for new tables
- [ ] No dollar-quoting (MCP compatibility)
- [ ] Boundary check (only `hmso` objects)
- [ ] UUID primary keys with `gen_random_uuid()`

---

## PHASE 4: OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS CHECK (If Applicable)

- [ ] Does this rely on people "remembering"? → Redesign
- [ ] Does this assume "good behavior"? → Add enforcement
- [ ] Can an average new hire execute this? → If no, simplify

---

## DELIVERABLES

### Executive Summary
```
**Assessment:** [Ready / Minor Revision / Needs Revision / Needs Splitting]
**Scope:** [Single-purpose / Multi-domain / Needs splitting]
**Key Issues:** [Top 3 blockers]
**Recommendation:** [Proceed / Revise / Split]
```

### Required Changes (with Code Snippets)
```
**Fix Immediately:**
1. [Issue] → [Specific fix]

**Clarify Before Implementation:**
1. [Ambiguity] → [Recommended solution]
```

### Standards Compliance
```
- [ ] hmso schema used ✅/❌
- [ ] Object registry registration ✅/❌
- [ ] Migration-first workflow ✅/❌
- [ ] RLS policies defined ✅/❌
- [ ] No dollar-quoting ✅/❌
- [ ] Service layer pattern ✅/❌
```
